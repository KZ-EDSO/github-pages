## 1.3. Scope and Objectives of Use Case

*Scope and objectives of use case*

|||
| --- | --- |
| **Scope** | Communities with a high penetration of photovoltaic systems and correspondingly large installed generation capacity can be expected to generate an energy surplus during times of peak generation and low local demand, and vice versa to run into an energy deficit during seasons of low generation. Surplus energy can be stored and shifted to times of low generation in order to satisfy temporary demand and hence increase the degree of self-sufficiency up to 100%. UC 2 demonstrates the ability and practical feasibility of a local community to maintain constant power exchange with the distribution network for a previously defined duration. <br/> Networks: LV <br/> Markets: None|
| **Objective(s)** | Maintain constant defined power exchange between energy community and the distribution network for a defined duration |
| **Related business case(s)** | Improving reliability of grid operation/grid security: <br/> - Integration in Congestions Management Mechanism via provision of grid stabilizing power/energy <br/> - Voltage Management <br/> - Peak Shaving <br/> - Reactive Power Provision |

## 1.4. Narrative of Use Case


**Short description**

Local energy communities (LEC, CEC) are likely to emerge in Europe in the near future but will most likely retain an interconnection to the distribution grid. These communities will require a large share of flexibility to enable their primary use case. Situations could arise that require the LEC to provide flexibility to a third party –driven by technical circumstances, such as a demand of system security triggered by the DSO or following economic considerations (market incentives). UC2 demonstrates the ability and practical feasibility of a local community to maintain constant power exchange with the distribution network for a previously defined duration.
